Guido - Has list funcionailty, only accessible on Processing 3 though.
G4P - 2012-2013 funcitonality, probably not compataible with Processing 4. Did not test out.
Interfascia - Has basic functions, it's alright but only possible usuable function would be the text_field example.
ControlP5 - Got it to show up on the app, but needs alot of configuration before it's fully intergrated in our code.
